                <p>
                    Though there are various pros to social media there are also negative impacts from it as well. Social media can Create low self esteem and body image issues due to the unrealistic beauty standards exposed on social media. This can turn people to using filters and getting surgeries to make themselves look “better”. Depression an suicidal thoughts have also heavily increased due to social media. One being nearly 2 in 3 adults are “often” or “sometimes” exposed to hate-based content on social media. Along with that social media has huge impacts on sleep which disrupts neurological development leading people to depression. Missing out on real-world friendships and socialization opportunities is a huge problem as well due to the lack of face to face communication.

                <h2>Effects of Social Media</h2>
                <h3>Depression, Anxiety, Insomonia, and Addiction</h3>
                <p>Social media is a dangerous threat. There are many different things that could go wrong. “So overall, Snapchat features can lead to mental health issues like anxiety, depression, insomnia, and addiction” (Vantage Point). Let me break down what some of these issues can look like.
                    Anxiety is a feeling of fear, dread, and uneasiness. It can be a permanent medical condition or just something someone feels in a specific moment. There are also specific types, like social anxiety, which relates to discomfort or distress in social settings. Social media can easily make this worse. The constant need to compare yourself to others or the pressure to look perfect online adds to this. On social media, people only see the best parts of each other’s lives, and that makes it easy to feel like you’re not doing enough. With constant notifications, posts, and messages flooding your feed, the pressure grows, leaving you feeling tense or anxious if you're not keeping up. Over time, this can turn into a regular feeling, where you feel on edge, even outside of social media.

                    The constant exposure to others’ opinions, whether through comments or the number of likes on a post, can make a person overly self-conscious. This feeling of being judged or not measuring up to standards can lead to a general sense of unease. Even worse, people often face harsh or critical comments online, which can deeply affect their mental state, pushing their anxiety even further.

                    Depression is another concern. It’s different from anxiety in that it often lingers, affecting a person’s mood and energy over long periods. Depression can make you feel uninterested in things, down, or hopeless. Social media can easily fuel these feelings. Scrolling through endless images of people with seemingly perfect lives might make someone feel like they aren’t living up to expectations. This feeling of missing out, known as FOMO (fear of missing out), often worsens depression. The constant exposure to content that suggests others are living better, happier lives can intensify the feeling that one’s own life is lacking or insignificant.

                    Additionally, depression can make users withdraw from real-life interactions and become more isolated. Ironically, while social media is supposed to connect people, it often leaves them feeling more alone. Users may start to believe that their own lives can’t compare to the glamorous highlights they see online, which makes their existing struggles feel even heavier.

                    Insomnia is another issue. It refers to trouble with sleep, whether it's difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up and not being able to go back to sleep. Social media plays a big role here, too, especially with how much people tend to scroll through their phones before bed. The blue light emitted from phone screens affects melatonin, a hormone that signals to your brain when it’s time to sleep. This messes with your body’s natural sleep cycle, making it harder to fall asleep or stay asleep.

                    On top of the blue light problem, engaging with social media before bed can be too stimulating. Watching exciting or emotional content keeps the brain active, making it difficult to wind down and relax. Even if someone manages to fall asleep, their sleep quality might be lower, and they could find themselves waking up feeling unrested.

                    Addiction is pretty straightforward. It’s when you become dependent on something, and in this case, that something is social media. Social media apps are designed to keep you hooked, and the more you use them, the harder it becomes to stop. Addiction isn’t just a strong interest in something; it’s a compulsion, meaning you can’t quit even if you want to. A lot of that has to do with how the platforms are built to reward users with dopamine spikes whenever they get a like, comment, or notification. This creates a cycle where users seek that high again and again.

                    When someone becomes addicted to social media, it starts to impact their daily life. They may neglect personal relationships, responsibilities, or even physical health because they’re so focused on what’s happening online. This kind of behavior leads to a downward spiral, where the more someone uses social media, the harder it becomes to step away, trapping them in a cycle of compulsive behavior.

                    In summary, social media can lead to anxiety, depression, insomnia, and addiction. The constant pressure, overstimulation, and addictive nature of these platforms can take a toll on mental health. While social media can be a tool for staying connected or entertained, it’s important to recognize when it’s becoming harmful. Being mindful of your habits and taking breaks from social media can go a long way in protecting your mental well-being.
