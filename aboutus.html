                <p>Hi, welcome to our page! My name is Finley Devins and I am a freshman ETBD student here at Miami University. I am from Cleveland, Ohio and live in a smaller suburb with my three brothers, parents, and dog Sugar. For fun I love to shop, travel, exercise, and hang with friends and family. I am also super into fashion so I am thinking of maybe adding a minor! I also plan to join a few clubs this fall here in Miami.</p>
