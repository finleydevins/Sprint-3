                    <h2>How is it disruptive?</h2>
                    <h3>Disruptive Technology Social Media</h3>
                </hgroup>
                <p>In today’s social media rich society, adults are spending 20-28 hours online per week engaging with their more than 275 personal relationships on social platforms. Social in both our business and personal lives is shaking up the way we communicate, making it easier, but now posing a different challenge being not spending enough time off of the phone. Social media has disrupted the way we think, behave, and go about everyday life. It’s changed how we interact with people, look for and share information, express opinions and voice complaints, shop, and even how we handle emotional relationships. This is why we love it. Social media knows this well, and could actually be the poster child for disruption. Social media makes it wildly easy to persuade people into virtually anything. The younger generation’s bringing up has been altered because of the lasting disruptive effects.

                <h2>How life has changed because of it</h2>
                <h3>Disruptive Technology Social Media</h3>
                <p>As a whole, the social trend is changing the way businesses are operating and therefore the way they are communicating with their customers, prospects and employees and as our work lives and professional lives continue to blend together more fluidly. Over 50 percent of brands who’ve used social media for two years or more say that it has helped them grow their sales.Ninety percent of companies say their social media efforts have generated more exposure for their business.Over 60 percent of businesses that spend at least six hours a week on social media marketing see improvements in their search engine rankings. Two-thirds of businesses see lead generation benefits from just six hours a week on social media. Jobs such as marketing have been changed exponentially because of social media. Now a common and important job is “social media marketer” Because if anything has changed the way people engage with people, and businesses engage with customers, it’s social media.
